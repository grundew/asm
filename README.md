Angular spectrum method
===
This is code computes the time domain response of a transmitter-layered media-receiver setup. Ofte then layer medium is a plate with a surrounding medium, often some kind of fluid or gas.


Implemented features
---

- Pulse-echo setup
- Throughtransmission
- (Misalignment) angle between transmitter and the layered media
- Displaced receiver from the acoustical axis
