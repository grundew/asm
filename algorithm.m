% Algorithm
%
% 1. Choose distance from transducers to plate, h1 & h2.
% 2. Choose q's (k's) and f's.
% 3. Calculate reflection and transmission coefficients.
% 4. Calculate plane wave Fourier coefficients of the incoming pressure.
% 5. Calculate the integral, phase shifting the wave and
%    multiplying the reflection/transmission coefficient
% 6. Convolve with the excitation signal.
